A college student who gets attacked by a ghoul and has to conceal his identity in Tokyo becomes a half-ghoul in the manga series and adaptation Tokyo Ghoul.

Number 2 is **Samurai Champloo**.

As they set out on their mission to find the elusive "sunflower samurai"—or more accurately, "the man who smells of sunflowers"—three characters from radically diverse backgrounds end up joining forces. In spite of their differences, Mugen, Fuu, and Jin travel through the fascinating regions of feudal Japan, conquering challenges and finding their own calling.

At last, Number 1 is **Bleach**.


In Bleach, Ichigo Kurosaki, a high school student, acquires the abilities of a Soul Reaper and is tasked with protecting the world from bad spirits.
